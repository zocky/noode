Noode is a new system which makes programming fun again!

See http://wiki.ljudmila.org/Noode

Run "make package" to build a debian package in parent directory.

Run "make tarball" to (re)build tarball in parent directory if downloaded from git 
since we really don't have upstream tarball. 

Tarball is needed to make a debian package.

You need to rebuild a tarball, if you make changes and want to build a package.
